# Approval Workflow Implementation

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of an approval workflow system for QA database and knowledge base content management in the KnowTax system.

## Implementation Date
December 12, 2024

## Scope
- QA database content approval workflow
- Knowledge base content approval workflow
- Admin and Manager role-based approval processes
- Status tracking and audit trail

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables Added
1. **approval_requests** - Main approval request tracking
2. **approval_history** - Audit trail for all approval actions

### approval_requests Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE approval_requests (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    content_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,  -- 'qa' or 'knowledge'
    content_id INTEGER,                 -- Reference to original content
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(100),
    tags VARCHAR(500),
    submitter_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    submitter_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
    priority VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'normal', -- 'low', 'normal', 'high', 'urgent'
    reviewer_id INTEGER,
    reviewer_name VARCHAR(100),
    review_comment TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    reviewed_at TIMESTAMP,
    action_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL    -- 'create', 'update', 'delete'
);
```

### approval_history Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE approval_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    request_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,        -- 'submitted', 'approved', 'rejected', 'modified'
    actor_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    actor_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    actor_role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    comment TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (request_id) REFERENCES approval_requests(id)
);
```

## Workflow Process

### 1. Content Submission
- Service users can submit new QA pairs or knowledge base entries
- Content goes into approval_requests table with status 'pending'
- Automatic notification to managers/admins

### 2. Review Process
- Managers can review and approve/reject QA submissions
- Admins can review and approve/reject both QA and knowledge base submissions
- Reviewers can add comments and modify content before approval

### 3. Status Tracking
- **Pending**: Awaiting review
- **Approved**: Content approved and published
- **Rejected**: Content rejected with reason
- **Modified**: Content modified during review process

### 4. Priority Levels
- **Low**: Non-urgent content updates
- **Normal**: Standard content submissions
- **High**: Important policy updates
- **Urgent**: Critical tax law changes requiring immediate attention

## User Role Permissions

### Admin Users
- Can approve/reject all content types (QA + Knowledge Base)
- Can modify content during review
- Can override manager decisions
- Full access to approval history and analytics

### Manager Users
- Can approve/reject QA database content
- Can review knowledge base content (recommend to admin)
- Can modify QA content during review
- Access to QA approval history

### Service Users
- Can submit content for approval
- Can view status of their submissions
- Can modify pending submissions before review

## New Features Implemented

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. QA Content Approval
- Service user submits new QA pair
- Manager reviews and approves
- Content appears in QA database

### 2. Knowledge Base Approval
- Service user submits knowledge article
- Admin reviews and modifies content
- Admin approves modified version
- Content appears in knowledge base

### 3. Rejection Workflow
